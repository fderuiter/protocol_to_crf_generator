# Protocol to CRF Generator

Welcome to the documentation for the Protocol to CRF Generator project. This tool converts clinical study protocols into CDISC-compliant Case Report Form artefacts.

The full documentation set, including design specifications and requirements, is organised under the `spec` folder. See the [Documentation Table of Contents](spec/table-of-contents.md) for an overview of all available documents.

You can now explore our [GitHub Models overview](github_models.md) to understand how large language models are incorporated into the project. Learn more about [prototyping with AI models](prototyping_with_ai_models.md) to experiment with different options.
For step-by-step guidance on refining prompts, read [Optimizing your AI-powered app with Models](optimizing_with_models.md).
To learn how to test and score model outputs, see [Evaluating AI models](evaluating_ai_models.md).
For details on storing prompts, read [Storing prompts in GitHub repositories](storing_prompts.md).
To integrate models into your workflow, see [Integrating AI models into your development workflow](integrating_ai_models.md).
