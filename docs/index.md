# Protocol to CRF Generator

Welcome to the documentation for the Protocol to CRF Generator project. This tool converts clinical study protocols into CDISC-compliant Case Report Form artefacts.

The full documentation set, including design specifications and requirements, is organised under the `spec` folder. See the [Documentation Table of Contents](spec/table-of-contents.md) for an overview of all available documents.

Prompt templates for common data-management scenarios are provided in the [prompt_templates](prompt_templates) directory.
