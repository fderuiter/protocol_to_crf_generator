# Risk Register & Mitigation Plan

The following register tracks key project risks derived from the [CDISC CRF Generation Technical Plan](../../CDISC%20CRF%20Generation%20Technical%20Plan_.md). Impact and Probability are scored from 1 (low) to 5 (high). Exposure is calculated as **Impact Ã— Probability**. Severity icons are coded as:

- ðŸŸ¥ Critical (16â€“25)
- ðŸŸ§ High (10â€“15)
- ðŸŸ¨ Medium (5â€“9)
- ðŸŸ© Low (1â€“4)

| ID | Risk Description | Impact | Probability | Exposure | Severity | Mitigation Actions | Owner |
| --- | --------------- | :----: | :---------: | :------: | :-----: | ----------------- | ----- |
| R1 | Nonâ€‘compliance with 21 CFR PartÂ 11 audit requirements | 5 | 3 | 15 | ðŸŸ§ | Implement immutable audit log and CI/CD validation steps as outlined in the Technical Plan | Project Lead |
| R2 | Inaccurate NLP extraction leading to incorrect CRF mappings | 4 | 4 | 16 | ðŸŸ¥ | Use ruleâ€‘based spaCy pipelines with regression corpus; continuously evaluate accuracy metrics | NLP Engineer |
| R3 | Controlled terminology updates break existing mappings | 3 | 4 | 12 | ðŸŸ§ | Automate CT update process and regression tests on mapping logic | Project Lead |
| R4 | Security vulnerability in openâ€‘source dependencies | 4 | 3 | 12 | ðŸŸ§ | Integrate Bandit and Semgrep scans in CI; apply dependable tooling for upgrades | Tech Lead |
| R5 | Singleâ€‘developer bandwidth delays delivery | 3 | 2 | 6 | ðŸŸ¨ | Prioritize backlog, automate testing, seek community contributions | Project Lead |
| R6 | Data leakage of proprietary protocol content | 5 | 2 | 10 | ðŸŸ§ | Enforce leastâ€‘privilege access; containerize and isolate storage; audit API usage | Tech Lead |
